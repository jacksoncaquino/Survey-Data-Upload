# Survey-Data-Upload
I started with this project as a teacher who had to manually type the grades of all my students manually to a web page on our learning management system. Years later I saw an opportunity to use it again when I saw myself in front of a huge table asking about attrition data in a Qualtrics survey from one of our survey vendors. Coded in VBA.

When starting the macro, the following message appears:

WARNING

This macro will use your keyboard to input your data from the current selection into the webpage table.

Before moving forward, please make sure that:

• You're able to navigate the page's table by using the TAB key on the keyboard

• When you hit tab on the last column of the page's table it goes to the next row

• You already have the right selection on your excel sheet (usually without the headers)

If you're ready to move forward, please click the OK button. Please, note that you will have 8 seconds to go to the first cell of the website table where you want your data inserted.
